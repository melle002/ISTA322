#### Homework

Read chapter 16, pages 329 – 352 in the C# Step by Step book.
#### Discussion Questions
Answer the discussion questions in writing.
##### 1. Give ﬁve examples (using valid C# code) of the ﬁve bitwise operators listed in the text.


##### 2. Does C# implement the right-shift (>>) operator? If so, give an example of its operation using valie C# code.
yes, opposite of the left

##### 3. Explain in detail this code: bits & (1 << index);.
 Access the first bit from the right

##### 4. Explain in detail this code: bits |= (1 << index);.
 

##### 5. Explain in detail this code: bits &= (1 << index);.


##### 6. How does C# interpret this? bool peek = bits[n];


##### 7. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] = true;


##### 8. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] ^= true;


##### 9. Assume that users were assigned read, write, and execute permissions according to this scheme: read = 1, write = 2, execute = 4. How would you interpret the following user permissions:(a) permission = 0 (b) permission = 1 (c) permission = 2 (d) permission = 3 (e) permission = 4 (f) permission = 5 (g) permission = 6 (h) permission = 7


##### 10. Answer the previous question by converting the decimal permissions into binary permissions. What does this tell you about using this shceme of permissions?
